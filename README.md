The Bankist Web Application is a static web-based banking application developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was created as part of a JavaScript course on Udemy, showcasing the practical implementation of fundamental web development concepts.

This application provides users with a simulated banking experience, allowing them to explore various functionalities. Users can perform basic operations such as taking loans and making withdrawals, all based on static data. The loan feature enables users to request loans by specifying the desired amount, while the withdrawal feature allows them to access their funds.

One notable functionality of the Bankist Web Application is the timer feature. The timer is implemented to automatically log out the user after a specified period of inactivity, enhancing security.

Although this application does not include server-side functionality or dynamic data retrieval, it serves as a practical demonstration of core web development techniques and showcases the implementation of essential banking operations.
